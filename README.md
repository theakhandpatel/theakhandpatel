## About Me

Hey there,

I am **Akhand Patel**, a recent graduate from the Master's program in Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Bhubaneswar. I have a keen interest in web development and networking. I'm proficient in React and Node.js, and I'm currently learning Golang. You might even find me working on my own Twitter clone someday!

Here is my [Resume](https://theakhandpatel.github.io/files/resume.pdf) for more details.

## Why is my website not using the latest frameworks?

Because I don't need to. I believe in simplicity and efficiency. If you're curious about this approach, check out the philosophy of [mother*******website](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/).
